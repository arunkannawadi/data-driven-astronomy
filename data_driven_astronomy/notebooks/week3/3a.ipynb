    "What if we want to work with subsets of the table simultaneously?\n",
    "\n",
    "But first of all, what do we mean by working with different subsets simultaneously?\n",
    "Imagine the following problem: we want to find out if there are multiple planets within the `Planet` table that have the same size, as measured by their radius.\n",
    "How can we do that?\n",
    "We can write a simple query in which we order the results such that we can see multiple occurences of the same radius:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT radius FROM Planet\n",
    "ORDER BY radius asc;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not really useful to look at.\n",
    "Much better would be, if we could count the radii which occur multiple times in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For situations like this, we can use the `GROUP BY` clause, which arranges identical data in groups on which we can perform aggregate functions, like `COUNT`.\n",
    "To solve our problem from above, we can query the table like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT radius, COUNT(koi_name)\n",
    "FROM Planet\n",
    "GROUP BY radius;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query returns a table which is grouped by the planet radii, and contains the radii and the number of **koi_names** belonging to each radius.\n",
    "We decided to count the **koi_name** attribute since this attribute is unique for each planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution still produces a somewhat lenghty table, but it's a lot better than our first approach.\n",
    "Let's have a look at how we can refine this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limited counting\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to restrict the results from the last slide to only those where the count is larger than one, we can add a condition for this value. Previously, we've added conditions using the `WHERE` clause, but if we try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "WHERE COUNT(koi_name) > 1\n",
