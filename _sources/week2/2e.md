# Towards a full cross-matching program

You now have all the tools necessary to crossmatch the BSS and SuperCOSMOS catalogues.
In the next problem you'll put it all together to see how many of the bright radio sources in the BSS catalogue have a counterpart in the SuperCOSMOS catalogue.
The process you should follow is:

1. Select an object from the BSS catalogue;
2. Go through all the objects in SuperCOSMOS and find the closest one to the BSS object;
3. If the objects are close enough, record the match;
4. Repeat 1-3 for all the other objects in the BSS catalogue.

In step 3, if the closest object isn't within a given distance then it's unlikely that the two objects are actually counterparts, and it's more likely that they just happen to be nearby.

The given distance you choose depends on the uncertainty of the measured object positions in each catalogue.

Although we are cross matching based solely on celestial coordinates in the following exercise, there are other properties we could consider while conducting research, such as the brightness and color of an object.
