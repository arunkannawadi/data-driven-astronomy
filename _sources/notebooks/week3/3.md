# Writing your own SQL queries

## Introduction

In these activities we'll introduce you to databases and how to work with them.
We start off with simple queries and work our way towards more advanced techniques to equip you with the skills required to use standard astronomical databases.

The theme of these activities is exoplanets â€“ planets that orbit stars different from our sun.
Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered and categorised using lots of criteria.
A natural way to organise and access this data is to use a database.
In these examples, we will use subsets of [NASA's exoplanet archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).
